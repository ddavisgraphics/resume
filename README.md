# Resume
Trying to manage my resume through JSON, so that it can be used in API's to generate content on various platforms.  Hoping that this will be part of the print / web verisons of my resume.  Schema found @https://jsonresume.org/schema/. 

# Current Position - Software Engineer with WVU
Just as a heads up, I'm very happy with my current position at WVU.  This resume is something I'm keeping up-to-date and revamped for freelance work and consulting. If you would like to talk about freelance or consulting please do not hesitate to call, or email.  Thanks!
