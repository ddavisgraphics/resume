    "summary": "I am a full stack developer that can not only design the application, but also produce highly effective functional applications. Higher education has helped me to hone my graphic design skills, programming skills, and taught me how to be life time learner.  At West Virginia University Libraries, I got the opportunity to take Gallup Strengths Finder Quiz, which allows you to get an un-bias idea of what skills you can bring to the table as a form of self-reflection.  My skills where communication, consistency, learner, achiever, and adaptability.  I believe that each of these skills is extremely useful in development.  Being able to learn and adapt to new technologies is often critical in my day-to-day work.  Communicating effectively with clients allows me to get a better idea of what they are looking for and help them achieve the goals of the application.   Consistency is needed day in and day out to stay on top of bugs, security, and trends in the industry. I am a full stack developer, and I love what I do!",

The first is to inform and teach designers the value and benefits of programming by means of creating web applications. The second acts as a catalyst to quickly engage the students using frameworks, visual learning, and learn-by-doing methodologies. The goal of the study is to further design curricula by finding a productive way to introduce programming concepts in a way that empowers the student."
